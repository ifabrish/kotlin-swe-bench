# Kotlin SWE-bench

A Kotlin software-engineering benchmark for evaluating coding agents.

The benchmark is built on the [Multi-SWE-bench](https://github.com/multi-swe-bench) methodology, extended
with Kotlin support. It is packaged in the **Harbor task format** — every task is a self-contained
directory with its own reproducible Docker environment, instruction, gold solution, and test verifier.

## Dataset

105 tasks across eight open-source Kotlin repositories:

| Repository | Tasks |
| :--- | ---: |
| [pinterest/ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) | 43 |
| [detekt/detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) | 28 |
| [oss-review-toolkit/ort](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort) | 12 |
| [Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA](https://github.com/Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA) | 8 |
| [ankidroid/Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android) | 6 |
| [Kotlin/dataframe](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe) | 5 |
| [square/okhttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) | 2 |
| [GradleUp/shadow](https://github.com/GradleUp/shadow) | 1 |
| **Total** | **105** |

For every task the dataset captures:

- the **base commit** (repository state before the change),
- the human-written **gold solution** patch,
- the **regression tests** that define the expected behavior,
- the natural-language **issue description**.

## Task structure (Harbor format)

Each task lives under `tasks/<owner>_<repo>-<pr_number>/` and is fully self-contained:

```
tasks/ankidroid_Anki-Android-18903/
├── task.toml                     # Task metadata + run config (timeouts, resources, internet)
├── instruction.md               # The issue/PR description handed to the agent
├── environment/                 # Docker build context for the task image
│   ├── Dockerfile               #   FROM a shared local base (kotlin-bench/<repo>:<base-tag>);
│   │                            #   runs prepare.sh, then adds agent tooling
│   ├── prepare.sh               #   checks out the base commit, warms the build cache
│   ├── check_git_changes.sh     #   asserts a clean working tree
│   └── exclude-flaky-tests.*    #   (some tasks) Gradle init script that skips flaky tests
├── solution/
│   ├── fix.patch                # The gold (reference) solution
│   └── solve.sh                 # Applies fix.patch — the "oracle" run
└── tests/
    ├── test.patch               # Adds/updates the hidden regression tests
    ├── test.sh                  # Applies test.patch, runs the suite, writes the reward
    ├── expected_tests.json      # Expected test transitions (f2p / p2p / s2p / n2p)
    ├── kotlin_logs_collector.sh # Collects JUnit XML from Gradle build output
    └── junit_compare.py         # Parses JUnit XML and computes the reward
```

### `task.toml`

```toml
[metadata.source]      # provenance: repo, PR/issue URLs, base info
[verifier]             # verification timeout
[agent]                # agent solving timeout
[environment]          # build timeout, cpus, memory_mb, allow_internet
```

### Scoring

`tests/test.sh` runs inside the task container after the agent's patch is applied. It:

1. applies `test.patch` to inject the regression tests,
2. runs the Gradle test suite,
3. collects JUnit XML via `kotlin_logs_collector.sh`,
4. compares the results against `expected_tests.json` with `junit_compare.py`, and
5. writes the final reward to `/logs/verifier/reward.txt` (`1` = resolved, `0` = not resolved).

Tests are classified by their status transition between the unpatched and patched runs:

- **f2p** — fail → pass (the bug being fixed)
- **p2p** — pass → pass (no regressions in already-passing tests)
- **s2p** / **n2p** — skip/new → pass

A task passes only when every expected test lands in its correct category.

## Base images

Task images are not self-contained from JDK up — they build `FROM` a shared base image that
bundles the JDK, any SDKs, and a clone of the upstream repo. A repository can have **several**
base variants on different JDKs (e.g. `kotlin-bench/pinterest_ktlint:base` on JDK 21 and
`kotlin-bench/pinterest_ktlint:base-JDK-17` on JDK 17); the variants differ in more than the JDK
line, so each has its own recipe. Base images need to be built once
before running any task:

```bash
scripts/build_bases.sh            # build every base listed in bases/manifest (skips existing)
scripts/build_bases.sh --rebuild  # force a rebuild
```

Each base recipe lives in `bases/<repo>/Dockerfile.<base-tag>` and is built as
`kotlin-bench/<repo>:<base-tag>`; `bases/manifest` lists all of them. Each task's
`environment/Dockerfile` selects the variant it needs via its `FROM` line.

## Running the benchmark

Tasks are run with the [Harbor](https://www.harborframework.com) CLI, which builds each task's
container from `environment/`, runs the agent against `instruction.md`, then executes
`tests/test.sh`. Install it with `uv tool install harbor`. See `harbor run --help` for available agents and flags.

```bash
# Build the shared base images once (see "Base images" above)
scripts/build_bases.sh

# Sanity-check a task with the Oracle agent (applies the gold patch; reward should be 1)
harbor run -p tasks/ankidroid_Anki-Android-18903 -a oracle

# Evaluate an agent on a single task
harbor run -p tasks/ankidroid_Anki-Android-18903 -a "<agent>" -m "<model>"

# Run the full suite (a dataset is just a directory of tasks)
harbor run -p tasks -a "<agent>" -m "<model>"
```
